1) The code first prints an ascending pattern of stars, starting from one star up to five stars.
Then, it prints a descending pattern of stars, starting from five stars down to one star.

2) The code first creates a list of numbers from 10 to 100.
Then, it slices the list to get every second number starting from the second element.
It loops through this sliced list and prints each number on the same line, separated by spaces.

3) The code creates a list x with mixed data types (integer, string, float).
It then initializes an empty list types.
It loops through each element in x, finds the data type of each element, and appends the data type to types.
Finally, it prints the original list x and the list types showing the data types of each element.

4) The code starts with a list sample_List that includes duplicate elements.
It creates an empty list unique_List to store unique elements.
It loops through each element in sample_List.
For each element, it checks if the element is not already in unique_List.
If the element is not in unique_List, it appends the element to unique_List.
Finally, it prints the original list and the list of unique elements.

5) The code defines a function count_case that counts the number of uppercase and lowercase letters in a given string.
It initializes counters for uppercase and lowercase letters.
It loops through each character in the string, checking if it is uppercase or lowercase, and updates the counters accordingly.
It returns the counts of uppercase and lowercase letters.
The function is called with the string 'The quick Brow Fox', and the results are printed.
